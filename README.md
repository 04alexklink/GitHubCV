## My story

I am a junior software developer with a background in market research, finance, and operations. I most recently worked for a global tech start-up where my ability to identify areas of improvement in our processes led me to often collaborate with the tech team. Being inquisitive I followed the development of their solutions closely and realised that moving forward in my career I wanted to build and develop solutions, not just contribute to the initial ideas. 

Having graduated from the Makers Academy Coding Bootcamp, I am eager to pair my newly learned technical skills with my aptitude for problem-solving within an ambitious yet supportive team environment.

## Skills

#### Adaptable and Fast Learner

- At Makers, I became accustomed to learning how core coding concepts were applied in different languages. Whilst the course was taught in Ruby and JavaScript, this approach meant for our final project I was able to build a chatbot using React, Python, and Flask, with no prior experience 
- At Airsorted, I demonstrated my ability to rapidly learn new skills that allowed me to carry out monthly and year-end accounting tasks in several cities and for our entire Lettings operation 
- During my time at Strategir, I was entrusted with managing projects from ideation to presentation, which was the result of quickly proving that I was capable of taking on all aspects of market research projects

#### Collaborative Approach and Teamwork

- At Airsorted I was commended on my willingness to help others and often worked collaboratively with other teams to discover what issues they were facing
- During group projects at Makers, on the days that I was assigned a leadership role, I focused on ensuring that everyone had clarity on the projects direction and felt able to offer input on the decisions we were making as a team
